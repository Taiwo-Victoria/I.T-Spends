## INTRODUCTION:
-----
This report is for visual representation of the analysis comparing the performance against the budget in order to determine the I.T cost variance whether favourable (actual<buget) or adverse(actual > budget). The datasets contains the fact datasets which are the 12 months worth of data, the Budget data and Forecast data (stored in a csv file exported from the accounting system), a 6 months worth of actual data and these datasets contains the date, I.T. department, cost element, country and prices. It also have the dimnsion tab les containing the groupings for the Cost elements, Religion(country), and Department.

This visual shows the decomposition charts of all the factors contributiong to the  I.T. cost variance (budget v forecast) It shows the effect of each attributes and their composition on the total variance. 

## What is the Actual YTD vs the Budget FY?

This is a guage chart showing the actual value for the last  6 months against the budget for the full year.
